# entropy
A Java command line application that calculates an information entropy of a password file.

#Description
This application was designed to aid in a mathematical project on calculating the entropy of data in information technology,
specificly password files.
The main goal was to upload a huge sample of password files and by counting occurences of each password and using processed
earlier formulas arrive at a numerical answer for the entropy.

The password sample used by me in my research is stored in the file passwords.txt
